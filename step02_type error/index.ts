//A type error in TypeScript occurs when a value is used in a way that is inncompatible with its type

//example:
let age : number ='23' // code will throw a type error because a string is being assigned to a variable age which type is number.

console.log(age); 


//TypeScript enforces type checking to ensure type safety.
